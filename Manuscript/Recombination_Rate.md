## How much does recombination rate vary?

Depending on who you talk to - recombination rate shows tremendous variation - or none at all?


1 cM = 0.01 CO/gen

**Sheep**

3748 (Male) and 2860 (Female) cM - Soay Sheep
[@Johnston2016]

Average 37.48 CO in males and 28.60 CO in females.

26 autosomes
1.10 CO/chr in females vs. 1.44 CO/chr in males

On average, there are 9 more CO per generation in males than in females OR approx. one additional CO per 3 chromosomes.





## Heritability 

h2 = 0.16 and 0.12 in females and males, respectively [@Johnston2016]
