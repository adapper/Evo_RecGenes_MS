## Align testes expression data to the reference genome for each species.

Data downloaded from NCBI Geo (SRA).

Alignment performed on Deepthought:
- dapper(at)deepthought.genetics.wisc.edu

Information about the alignment, including reference genome, SRA files, and mapping can be found in the README and Makefiles for each species on Deepthought.

## Use the expression data to identify the correct isoform/transcript for each gene.

Use IGVtools (2.4.2 & 2.3.92) to visualize alignments using both NCBI & Ensembl data.

- IGVtools in Programs folder on Desktop.
- Select reference genome from dropdown menu (.fa) and load annotation file (.gff3), and alignment files (.sorted.bam).  Files stored on red external harddrive due to size.

## Re-check alignment.

There are four files in this folder:
- Excel Spreadsheet
- README.md
- Isoform.md
- Align.md
