## Align testes expression data to the reference genome for each species.

Data downloaded from NCBI Geo (SRA).

Alignment performed on Deepthought:
- dapper@deepthought.genetics.wisc.edu

Information about the alignment, including reference genome, SRA files, and mapping can be found in the README and Makefiles for each species on Deepthought.

## Use the expression data to identify the correct isoform/transcript for each gene.

## Re-check alignment.

There are four files in this folder:
- Excel Spreadsheet
- README.md
- Isoform.md
- Align.md
